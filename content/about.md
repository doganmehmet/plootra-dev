Hi there, 

I am Mehmet. I have a background in Quantitative Finance and I like doing stuff with R and Python. 

This website is made with R using "blogdown" package and deployed to Digital Ocean. Thanks [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/) for this amazing package. 

If you would like to learn more about "blogdown" visit:

To download R:

It uses Hogo framework:

And a big thanks to [Nanxiaobei](https://github.com/nanxiaobei) for developing "Hugo Paper" theme and making accessible to everyone.
