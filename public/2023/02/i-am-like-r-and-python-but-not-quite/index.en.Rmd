## A mini-funny Julia crash course for Python and R users

Hello, World!
I'm **Julia**. I'm like Python and R but I have my personality.

You can [run me online](https://julialang.org/learning/tryjulia/) to follow this tutorial if you haven't installed me already.


```{r, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(JuliaCall)
```

## Printing
I can print everything using ***print()*** or ***println()***
- ***print()***: prints on the same line
- ***println()***: adds a new line to the end of the output

```{julia}
println("Hello, I'm Julia")
println("I'm like like Python and R, but not quite")
```
## Package management

### Installing a package
I install new packages using:
- ***Pkg.add("package_name")***
```{julia}
using Pkg
#Pkg.add("DataFrames") 
```


### Adding a package to current session 
I add packages to my current session via ***using*** keyword:
- ***using package_name***
```{julia}
using Plots # similar to base R plot, matplotlib in Python
using Gadfly # similar to ggplot2, not similar to anything in python - this was never achieved in Python
using RDatasets # equivalent of rdatasets package
using DataFrames # similar to data.frame, data.table and dplyr in R, pandas in Python
using CSV # similar to read.csv, readr in R, pandas in Python
using Statistics # similar to base R, base Python
using Dates # similar to date in base R and datetime in python
```

## Control Flow

### If statement
- I'm like Python but without **:**
- like R but w/o ugly ***{ }s***
- I must end with ***end***
- Unlike Python I don't need ***indentation*** but I prefer to have it.
```{julia}
if 5 > 0 
    println("Print me")
elseif 10 > 0 # - I have elseif in the middle, just like R
    println("Print me instead")
else
    println("Better to print me")
end
```
### While loop
- I'm like Python but without **:**
- like R but w/o ugly ***{ }s***
- I must end with ***end***
- Unlike Python I don't need ***indentation*** but I prefer to have it.
- If I want to access a global variable inside of me I set ***global variable_name***.
```{julia}
x = 5;
while x > 0 
    global x
    println("Print me $x") 
    x -= 1
end 
```

### For loop
- I'm like Python but without **:**
- like R but w/o ugly ***{ }s***
- I must end with ***end***
- Unlike Python I don't need ***indentation*** but I prefer to have it.
```{julia}
for i in 1:10 
    print(i, ",")
end
```
## Functions
- I'm like R but w/o ugly ***{ }s***
- I must end with ***end***
- Unlike Python I don't need ***indentation*** but I prefer to have it.
```{julia}
function square_number(y)  
    return y^2
end
```


### Calling a function
I'm just like R and Python
```{julia}
square_number(10)
```

### I'm Awesome!
```{julia}
square_number.([1,2,3,4,5]) # it will square each number in the vector
```

## DataFrames
I'm like R and a bit of Python
```{julia}
df = DataFrame(Stock=["A", "B", "C", "D"], Price=1:4)
```
### Slicing DataFrames
I'm like R and Python but not quite. 
- I don't need annoying **loc** and **iloc** 
- I don't complain about copying.
```{julia}
df.Stock # all elements of Stock column
```

```{julia}
df[:, "Stock"] # all rows of Stock column
```

```{julia}
df[:, 2] # all rows of Price column
```

```{julia}
df[1:3, :] # first 3 rows of each column
```

```{julia}
df[[begin, end], "Price"] # first and the last rows of Price column 
```

```{julia}
df[[1,3], 2] # the first and the third rows of Price (2nd) column
```

```{julia}
# Another DataFrame
stockPrices = DataFrame(
    Date = ["2022-01-31","2022-02-28","2022-03-31","2022-04-30","2022-05-31","2022-06-30","2022-07-31","2022-08-31","2022-09-30","2022-10-31","2022-11-30","2022-12-31",
    "2022-01-31","2022-02-28","2022-03-31","2022-04-30","2022-05-31","2022-06-30","2022-07-31","2022-08-31","2022-09-30","2022-10-31","2022-11-30","2022-12-31"],
    Stock=["TSLA","TSLA","TSLA","TSLA","TSLA", "TSLA","TSLA","TSLA","TSLA","TSLA","TSLA","TSLA",
    "NFLX","NFLX","NFLX","NFLX","NFLX","NFLX","NFLX","NFLX","NFLX","NFLX","NFLX","NFLX"],
    Price=[312.24,290.14,359.2,290.25,252.75,224.47,297.15,275.61,265.25,227.54,194.7,121.82,
    427.14,394.52,374.59,190.36,197.44,174.87,224.9,223.56,235.44,291.88,305.53,291.12]
)
```
### Converting a ***String*** column to ***Date***
I have my own syntax. 
```{julia}
stockPrices.Date = Date.(stockPrices.Date, "yyyy-mm-dd")
```

```{julia}
### Frist 5 elements - I'm like R and Python but "first" instead of "head"
first(stockPrices, 5)

### Last 5 elements - I'm like R and Python but "last" instead of "tail"
last(stockPrices, 5)
```

## Importing and exporting data

### Writing a DataFrame to csv
I'm like R and Python but I have my own syntax. 
- I first accept ***filename.csv*** 
- and then DataFrame ***name***

```{julia}
CSV.write("stockPrices.csv", stockPrices)
```

### Reading data from csv as DataFrame
I am neither Python nor R.
- First ***import*** me 
- and then hug me with ***DataFrame()***
```{julia}
stockPrices = DataFrame(CSV.File("stockPrices.csv"))
```


### Group by and combine
I have my own syntax for groupby. 
- I'm first ***grouping by*** 
- then ***combining***
```{julia}
grp = groupby(stockPrices, :Stock) 
avg_prices = combine(grp, :Price => mean)
```

### Filtering
- I'm way better than Python,
- but slightly uglier than R
```{julia}
filter(row -> row.Stock == "NFLX", stockPrices) # filter values for Netflix
```

```{julia}
# you can use any name in place of row
filter(DonaldTrump -> DonaldTrump.Stock == "NFLX", stockPrices) # I will be gladly working as well
```

## Plotting

### Plotting with *Plots.jl* 

- I'm similar to base plot in R, matplotlib in Python
- I'm way better than Python,
- and similar to R
```{julia}
Plots.plot(1:10, 1:10, label = "Stock Price", linewidth = 2, title = "Stock Price");
Plots.plot!(xlabel = "Date");
Plots.plot!(ylabel = "Price")
```

### Plotting with *Gadfly.jl*
- I'm similar to ***ggplot2*** in **R**,
- **not similar to anything** in Python. **Python never succeeded in plotting**.
- I'm way way way better than Python,
- but less sophisticated than R.
- I know R is by far the best in Plotting
- but I'm doing my best to catch it.
```{julia}
Gadfly.plot(stockPrices, x=:Date, y=:Price, Geom.line, color = :Stock)
```
